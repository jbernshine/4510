[[6863,1],0]: A high-performance Open MPI point-to-point messaging module
was unable to find any relevant network interfaces:

Module: OpenFabrics (openib)
  Host: helium-03

Another transport will be used instead, although this may result in
lower performance.

Beginning julia set computation...

ORTE has lost communication with its daemon located on node:

  hostname:  helium-05.cs.umanitoba.ca

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
